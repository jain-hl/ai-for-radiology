# Deep Learning in Radiology: A Critical Analysis of Geoffrey Hinton’s Vision

## Introduction

The emerging influence of deep learning within the AI revolution has affected procedures in medicine and clinical practice, with the development of AI models in medical imaging and radiotherapy posing questions surrounding the need for radiologists in the near future.

Geoffrey Hinton, a prominent computer scientist and deep learning expert famously said in 2016: “We should stop training radiologists now. It’s just completely obvious that within five years, deep learning is going to do better than radiologists. Any old problem where you have to predict something and you have a lot of data, deep learning is probably going to make it work better than the existing techniques”.

Hinton’s statement about the potential of deep learning in radiology sparked considerable debate across the fields of AI and healthcare. Since 2016, deep learning has made significant advancements which are being increasingly integrated into radiological practice, yet the complete replacement and hence redundancy of radiologists and the profession’s respective training has not occurred.

Radiology is a branch of medicine that uses imaging techniques to diagnose diseases within a patient. This subdivides into a variety of imaging techniques such as X-rays, ultrasound, CT, PET, MRI etc. These imaging modalities provide detailed images of internal structures of the body without invasive procedures, playing a crucial role in detecting conditions such as cancer, heart disease and other internal injuries.

Radiology is broadly categorised into diagnostic radiology and interventional radiology. The former focuses on the use of imaging techniques to diagnose diseases, whereas the latter uses such image analysis to guide minimally invasive surgical procedures, such as biopsies, draining fluids or inserting catheters [1]. The common direction for this debate focuses on the diagnosis, however I argue that it is paramount to maintain a distinction for the role of AI between diagnostic and interventional radiology. I maintain that deep learning can significantly improve the detection and diagnosis of diseases in the short term, however will not be able to replace the medical precision required for interventional radiological practice anytime soon. Another important consideration involves using AI to improving medical education of both diagnostic and interventional radiology, offering more realistic simulation scenarios which are continuously updated on the latest medical information.
